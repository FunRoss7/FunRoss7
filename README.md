- 👋 Hi, I’m Ross
- 👀 I’m interested in code to advance the arts of sailing, autonautics, and engineering in general.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning tensorflow and opencv.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a general solution to the Navier-Stokes Equations... once I get my prototype working.
- 📫 How to reach me: email me at ross.f.carlson@gmail.com

Reach out if you see cool stuff and have questions, I'm happy to talk about everything!
